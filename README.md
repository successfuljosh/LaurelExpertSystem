LAUREL: THE LAPTOP DIAGNOSTICS EXPERT
Laurel is a Rule-Based Diagnostic Expert Systems: Rule-based expert systems have a wide range of applications for diagnostic tasks where expertise and experience are available but deep understanding of the physical properties of the system is either unavailable or too costly to obtain. In the rule-based systems, knowledge is represented in the form of production rules. A rule describes the action that should be taken if a symptom is observed. The empirical association between premises and conclusions in the knowledge base is their main characteristic. These associations describe cause effect relationships to determine logical event chains that were used to represent the propagation of complex phenomena. The general architecture of these systems includes domain independent components such as the rule representation, the inference engine and the explanation system. Basic structure of a classical rule-based expert system is presented below.
